\chapter{Approach}
\label{cha:Approach}
In the last section a few approaches have been outlined and discussed, that have successfully implemented methods regarding the creation of audios/music with a neural network approach. As seen, these have been mainly categorized in neural audio synthesis and neural audio style transfer. There current work has its main influence from the area neural audio synthesis, and can be categorized as such, as the methodology and workflow is strongly related to those works. Nevertheless regarding certain components, it has also its influence from the style transfer methods, despite not defining a specific content or style audio respective loss functions.\\
This chapter will therefore dive into the methodology and exact workflow of this works' solution, to the problem that also will help to derive the answers to the defined research questions. First an Overview/Motivation should provide the reader with the intended idea and an overview of the applied methods, to get a general understanding of the idea (see section \ref{sec:app_overview}. Later on the single steps and components that are needed, in order reach the desired functionalities, are going to get described in detail, starting with the pre processing. Further on the ML-Model (neural network) will get described, as well as the step that is done to synthesize new sounds. Further on, the required steps for (re)generating a listenable audio as well as an description of the used dataset for training and also all experiments conducted later on (see chapter \ref{cha:Experiment}).

\section{Overview/Motivation}
\label{sec:app_overview}
Like mentioned in the beginning of this thesis, this work aims to explore the possibilities of machine learning techniques such as neural networks, to apply in the audio domain for sound generation. This idea is mainly inspired by the idea of taking two distinct audio sources and mixing their characteristics in order to generate a new sound. As seen in the previous chapter, this idea is strongly related to the image domain, where the "synthesis" of a new pictures based on two source images, is commonly known as image style transfer (point \ref{sec:rw_imgstyletransfer}). This technique, of having a content image to be stylised with a certain style from another image, would mean for the application in the audio, to have a style sound to be transferred onto a content/target sound. Such approaches are known as audio style transfer. <write something specific about the synthesis, inspiration from previous work, why synthesis was chosen above style transfer methods, proposed workflow (grob), explaining the figure down below, chosen tech stack, programming environment etc. >
